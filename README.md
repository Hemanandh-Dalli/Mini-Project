# Snake Game: A Modern Implementation with Multi-Player and Challenge Modes

This project presents a modernized version of the classic Snake game, implemented using Python and Pygame.
The game maintains the beloved core mechanics of the original - where players control a snake that grows longer upon consuming food while avoiding collisions with walls and itself - 
while introducing innovative features to enhance gameplay and user engagement.

The primary contribution of this implementation is the addition of two significant features: a two-player simultaneous play mode and a challenge level system. 
The two-player mode enables competitive gameplay on the same screen, allowing players to compete for food while avoiding collisions with each other and obstacles. 
The challenge level system introduces time-limited scenarios with specific targets, adding a new dimension of difficulty and strategic gameplay.

The game is developed using Python 3.8 and the Pygame library, employing object-oriented programming principles for maintainable and scalable code structure. 
The implementation includes robust collision detection, score tracking, and a high-score system. The user interface provides clear visual feedback through grid-based movement and color-coded elements.

This project demonstrates how classic game concepts can be expanded and enhanced through modern programming techniques while maintaining the simplicity and addictive nature of the original game. 
The modular design allows for future expansions, including potential online multiplayer functionality and customizable game elements.
